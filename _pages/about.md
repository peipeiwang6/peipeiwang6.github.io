**Why are the structures of spiral flowers flexible?**

Using *Nigella damascena* (love-in-a-mist) as a model system, we revealed that the expression profiles of floral organ identify genes are dymatic, and the genes regulate the boundaries between different types of floral organs by forming a complex regulatory network. Notably, the *AGL6*-lineage member *NdAGL6* is an A-function gene determining the identity of sepal and petal, rather than the *AP1*-lineage genes as in *Arabidopsis thaliana*.

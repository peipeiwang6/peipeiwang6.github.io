**I am currently interested in questions: **

How do genome assemblies, genotyping methods, variant and allelic types, ploidy levels impact genomic prediction?


What are the cis-regulatory codes of response to chilling treatment in Switchgrass?


How did the gene clusters arise and evolve?


How do the genomic environment impact the expression, function and evolution of duplicate genes?

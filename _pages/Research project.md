I am now working on or will focus on the following questions:

1. What are the mechanisms underlying important horticulure traits in flowers?
2. What are the mechanisms underlying gene loss for single-copy gene families following gene and genome duplications?
3. How do genome assemblies, genotyping methods, variant and allelic types, ploidy levels impact genomic prediction?
4. How did the metabolic gene clusters arise and evolve?
5. How well can we predict metabolic pathway genes using multiple omics data?
6. What are the cis-regulatory codes of response to chilling treatment in Switchgrass?
7. How does the relocation affect the expression, function, and evolutionary fate of duplicates?

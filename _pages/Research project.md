I am interested in questions about the evolution of plants, genes, plant genomes and transcriptomes. 

1.	Why are the structures of spiral flowers flexible?

2.	How do gene family sizes vary among related plant species?

3.	How well can the gene expression data be used to predict metabolic pathway memberships?

4.	What factors influence read coverage in a genome assembled using short reads?

5.	How do genome assemblies, genotyping methods, variant and allelic types, ploidy levels impact genomic prediction?

6.	What is the contribution of epigenetic variation to plant complex trait beyond genetic variation?

7.	What are the cis-regulatory codes of response to chilling treatment in Switchgrass?

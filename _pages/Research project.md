I am now working on or will focus on the following questions:

1. What are the mechanisms underlying important horticulure traits in flowers?
3. How do genome assemblies, genotyping methods, variant and allelic types, ploidy levels impact genomic prediction?
4. How did the metabolic gene clusters arise and evolve?
5. How well can we predict metabolic pathway genes using multiple omics data?

I am now working on or will focus on the following questions:

1. How do genome assemblies, genotyping methods, variant and allelic types, ploidy levels impact genomic prediction?
2. How can the deep learning approaches be used for automatically detecting and counting Arabidopsis seeds and siliques?
3. What are the cis-regulatory codes of response to chilling treatment in Switchgrass?
4. How did the metabolic gene clusters arise and evolve?
5. How well can we predict metabolic pathway genes using omics data?
6. What are the mechanisms underlying gene loss for single-copy gene families following gene and genome duplications?
7. How does the relocation of duplicates affect the expression, function, and fate of duplicates?
